# Titanic Survival Prediction Model

## Overview
This repository contains code and resources for predicting the survival of passengers on the Titanic using machine learning techniques.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the famous Titanic dataset, which contains information about passengers on the Titanic, including whether they survived or not. It includes features such as age, sex, ticket class, fare, and cabin.

## Code Structure
The repository is organized as follows:
- `data/`: Contains the dataset used for training and testing.
- `models/`: Contains the trained machine learning models.
- `src/`: Contains the source code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `notebooks/`: Contains Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, model development, and evaluation.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- scikit-learn
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook (for running the notebooks)

## Usage
To train the model and evaluate its performance, follow these steps:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Navigate to the `src/` directory.
4. Run the `train.py` script to train the model.
5. Use the trained model for prediction by running the `predict.py` script.
6. Evaluate the model's performance using the `evaluate.py` script.

## Results
The performance metrics of the trained model, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, are available in the evaluation reports generated by the `evaluate.py` script.

## Contributing
Contributions to improve the model or add new features are welcome. If you'd like to contribute, please fork the repository and create a pull request with your changes.
